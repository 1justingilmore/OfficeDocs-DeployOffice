# Request delegated admin access

> [!NOTE]
> This is pre-release documentation for a preview program that isnâ€™t available to everyone and is subject to change.

In order to manage a customer's service or subscription on their behalf, the customer must grant you administrator permissions for that service. To get administrator permissions from a customer, email them a reseller relationship request. After the customer approves your request, you'll be able to log on to the service's admin portal and manage the service on the customer's behalf.
