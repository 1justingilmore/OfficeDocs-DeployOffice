# Assess network and firewall settings

Before you deploy for the first time or migrate your customer to Office 365, you should estimate the bandwidth needs and then use these guidelines to test and verify that your customer has enough bandwidth to deploy or migrate to Office 365. 

Using Office 365 may increase the utilization of your customers organization's internet circuit. It's important to determine if the amount of bandwidth currently available is enough to handle the estimated increase once Office 365 is fully deployed while leaving at least 20% capacity to handle the busiest of days.

You should also check and update firewall settings to ensure that Office clients can connect to necessary online services. These need to be configured to allow Office 365 work correctly.
