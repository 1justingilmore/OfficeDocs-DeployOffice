# Choose update and language settings for deploying Office 365 ProPlus

Create configuration files that are used to deploy Office in large organizations. These configuration files give you more control over an Office installation: you can define which applications and languages are installed, how those applications should be updated, and application preferences. 

[To mange these settings you can use the Office Customization Tool](https://config.office.com/officeSettings/configure)
