> [!NOTE]
> This is pre-release documentation for a preview program that isnâ€™t available to everyone and is subject to change.

Ensure your customers end users are able to use Office 365 when you deploy Office to their machines. There is two methods to assign licenses for end users:

- Office Admin center
- Office 365 PowerShell

## Office Admin Center
1. In the admin center, go to the **Users** > **Active users** page.
2. Select the circles next to the names of the users to whom you want to assign licenses.
3. At the top, choose choose **Manage product licenses**.
4. In the **Manage product licenses** pane, choose **Add to existing product license assignments** > **Next**.
5. In the **Add to existing products** pane, switch the toggle to the **On** position for the license that you want the selected users to have.
6. By default, all services associated with that license are automatically assigned to the users. To limit which services are available to the users, switch the toggles to the **Off** position for the services that you don't want the users to have.
7. At the bottom of the pane, choose **Add** > **Close**.
