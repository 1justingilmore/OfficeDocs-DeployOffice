# Windows 7 end of support and Office 365 ProPlus

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Support for Windows 7 ends on January 14, 2020. [Learn more](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/end-of-windows-7-support)
>- If you’re a home user running Office on Windows 7, see [Windows 7 end of support and Office](https://support.office.com/article/78f20fab-b57b-44d7-8368-06a8493f3cb9) instead of reading this article.

Office 365 is governed by the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/30881/modern-lifecycle-policy) which requires customers to stay current as per the servicing and [system requirements](https://products.office.com/office-system-requirements) for the product or service. This includes using Office 365 ProPlus on a Windows operating system that is currently in support.

Using Office 365 ProPlus on older, unsupported operating systems may cause performance and reliability issues over time. Therefore, if your organization is using Office 365 ProPlus on devices running Windows 7, we strongly recommend your organization move those devices to [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/end-of-windows-7-support?rtc=1#office-ContentAreaHeadingTemplate-s9f0ou1).

## Security updates will continue for Office 365 ProPlus on Windows 7

Even though Windows 7 will no longer be supported after January 2020, we’ve decided to continue to provide you with security updates for Office 365 ProPlus for the next 3 years, until January 2023. We’re doing this to give you additional time to make the transition from running Office 365 ProPlus on devices running Windows 7 to a supported operating system, such as Windows 10. But, during that time, as long as the device is still running Windows 7, Office 365 ProPlus won’t receive any new features updates.

> [!NOTE]
> This information applies even if you have purchased Extended Security Updates (ESU) for Windows 7. After January 2020, security updates for Windows 7 are only available with ESU. For more information about ESU, see [Lifecyle FAQ-Extended Security Updates](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4497181/lifecycle-faq-extended-security-updates).

After you move Office 365 ProPlus to a supported Windows operating system, preferably Windows 10, you can configure Office 365 ProPlus to begin receiving feature updates again. Since updates for Office 365 ProPlus are cumulative, you will receive all the feature updates that you missed while the device was running Windows 7.


## What about other versions of Office on Windows 7?

Non-subscription versions of Office used by organizations, such as Office Professional Plus 2016 or Office Standard 2013, will continue to be supported based on the [Fixed Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/14085). To see specific end of support dates for non-subscription versions of Office, go to the [Search product lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search) page.

Even if your version of Office is still supported, Windows 7 will no longer receive security updates after January 2020, unless you have ESU, leaving it vulnerable to security threats. We recommend that you move to a [supported operating system](https://products.office.com/office-system-requirements), such as [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/end-of-windows-7-support?rtc=1#office-ContentAreaHeadingTemplate-s9f0ou1).
