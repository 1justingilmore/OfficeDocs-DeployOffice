# What's new: Deploying Office 365 ProPlus in the enterprise

We continue to add new features and capabilities to help you deploy and manage Office 365 ProPlus in your organizations. The following is an overview of these changes, with the most recent changes listed first.
  
    
    


## Use a new version of the Office Deployment Tool to manage Office 365 ProPlus deployments

In order to support new deployment capabilities available for the Office 2016 version of Office 365 ProPlus, there is a new version of the Office Deployment Tool. You can  [download this new version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=626065) from the Microsoft Download Center. The configuration.xml file used by the latest Office Deployment Tool supports new settings that allow you to configure update channels and install language accessory packs.
  
    
    
Also, be aware that the new version of the Office Deployment Tool can't be used to deploy the Office 2013 version of Office 365 ProPlus. You can continue to  [use the previous version of the Office Deployment Tool](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=36778) for those deployments.
  
    
    

## Use new Group Policy settings for Office 365 ProPlus

For the release of Office 2016, there is a new set of Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML) for Group Policy settings. You can  [download the Administrative Template files](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49030) from the Microsoft Download Center. Included in the download is an Excel file that contains a list of all the Group Policy settings as well as a list of the new policy settings for Office 2016.
  
    
    

## Determine how often to update to new features of Office 365 ProPlus by selecting an update channel

In Office 2016, you can control how fast your users receive feature updates to Office 365 ProPlus. One choice is a monthly update to Office 365 ProPlus, which can contain new or updated features, bug fixes, and security patches. This is called the Current Channel release.
  
    
    
If you prefer, you have the option to receive only security updates for Office 365 ProPlus each month, and instead defer for several months receiving any features changes and bug fixes. A few times a year, we'll provide an update to Office 365 ProPlus for you to test and deploy that contains those feature changes and bug fixes. This is called the Deferred Channel release.
  
    
    
For more information, see  [Overview of update channels for Office 365 ProPlus](overview-of-update-channels-for-office-365-proplus.md).
  
    
    

## View and manage users' installations of Office 365 ProPlus from the Office 365 admin center

Previously, only users could use the Office 365 portal to view a list of which computers they had installed Office 365 ProPlus on and deactivate an installation. Now, if you're a global admin or a user management administrator in Office 365, you can view which computers your users have installed Office 365 ProPlus on. Also, you can deactivate a user's installation of Office 365 ProPlus. To do this, go to the **Active Users** section of the Office 365 admin center, and then [follow these steps](https://blogs.technet.com/b/odsupport/archive/2015/06/22/office-365-proplus-user-activations-management.aspx).
  
    
    
In addition to Office 365 ProPlus installations, you can also view and manage installations of Visio Pro for Office 365, Project Professional 2010, and Office 2016 for Mac.
