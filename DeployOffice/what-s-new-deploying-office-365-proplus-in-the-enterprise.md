# What's new: Deploying Office 365 ProPlus in the enterprise

We continue to add new features and capabilities to help you deploy and manage Office 365 ProPlus in your organizations. The following is an overview of these changes, with the most recent changes listed first.
  
## Use a new version of the Office Deployment Tool to manage Office 365 ProPlus deployments

In order to support new deployment capabilities available for the Office 2016 version of Office 365 ProPlus, there is a new version of the Office Deployment Tool. You can [download this new version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=626065) from the Microsoft Download Center. The configuration.xml file used by the latest Office Deployment Tool supports new settings that allow you to configure update channels and install language accessory packs.
  
## Use new Group Policy settings for Office 365 ProPlus

For the release of Office 2016, there is a new set of Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML) for Group Policy settings. You can [download the Administrative Template files](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49030) from the Microsoft Download Center. Included in the download is an Excel file that contains a list of all the Group Policy settings as well as a list of the new policy settings for Office 2016.
  
## Determine how often to update to new features of Office 365 ProPlus by selecting an update channel
<a name="BKMK_Branch"> </a>

In Office 2016, you can control how fast your users receive feature updates to Office 365 ProPlus. One choice is a monthly update to Office 365 ProPlus, which can contain new or updated features, bug fixes, and security patches. This is called the Monthly Channel release.
  
If your organization doesn't want to deploy the latest features of Office right away or you have a significant number of line-of-business applications, add-ins, or macros that you need to test with Office, then Semi-Annual Channel might be the better choice for your organization. That's because new features are made available to Semi-Annual Channel only twice a year, in January and July, instead of every month. Semi-Annual Channel is the default update channel for Office 365 ProPlus.
  
For more information, see [Overview of update channels for Office 365 ProPlus](overview-of-update-channels-for-office-365-proplus.md).
  
## View and manage users' installations of Office 365 ProPlus from the Office 365 admin center
<a name="BKMK_Deactivate"> </a>

Previously, only users could use the Office 365 portal to view a list of which computers they had installed Office 365 ProPlus on and deactivate an installation. Now, if you're a global admin or a user management administrator in Office 365, you can view which computers your users have installed Office 365 ProPlus on. Also, you can deactivate a user's installation of Office 365 ProPlus. To do this, go to the **Active Users** section of the Office 365 admin center, and then[follow these steps](https://blogs.technet.com/b/odsupport/archive/2015/06/22/office-365-proplus-user-activations-management.aspx).
  
In addition to Office 365 ProPlus installations, you can also view and manage installations of Visio Pro for Office 365, Project Professional 2010, and Office 2016 for Mac.
