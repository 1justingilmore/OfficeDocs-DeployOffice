# Set preferences for Outlook for Mac

***Applies to:*** *Outlook for Mac, Outlook 2019 for Mac*

As an IT admin, you may want to provide Outlook for Mac users in your organization with a standard set of preferences in either of the following ways:

- Set a default preference, which users can change
- Force a particular preference, which users canâ€™t change

The following preferences can be used to simplify account setup for Office 365 mailboxes, help protect company data, and support a streamlined user experience.

These keys are CFPreferences-compatible, which means that it can be set by using enterprise management software for Mac, such as Jamf Pro.
