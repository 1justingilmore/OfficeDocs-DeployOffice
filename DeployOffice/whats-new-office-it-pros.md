Office 2019 is the latest version of Microsoft's productivity software that's available as a one-time purchase from a retail store or through a volume licensing agreement. Note that Office 2019 is separate from Office that's available through Office 365 plans. For example, if you've deployed Office 365 ProPlus to the users in your organization, you don't need Office 2019. You already have all the features, and many more, that are included in Office 2019.
