# What's new in Office deployment for IT Pros

This article lists new features, tools, and articles for IT Pros who deploy Office in the enterprise. For details on Office announcements and plans, see the [Microsoft 365 Roadmap](https://products.office.com/en-US/business/office-365-roadmap).

## February 2019

Microsoft Teams will be installed by default for *new* installations of Office 365 ProPlus, starting with Version 1902 in Monthly Channel. For more information, see [Deploy Microsoft Teams with Office 365 ProPlus](teams-install.md).

## January 2019

### Public preview of Office client policy service
A public preview is now available for the Office client policy service, which is a cloud-based service that enables you to enforce policy settings for Office 365 ProPlus on a user’s device, even if the device isn’t domain joined or otherwise managed. The policy settings roam to whichever device the user signs into and uses Office 365 ProPlus.

For more information, see the following resources:
 - [Announcing the new cloud-based policy management service for Office 365 ProPlus](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365-Blog/Announcing-the-new-cloud-based-policy-management-service-for/ba-p/310405)
 - [Overview of the Office client policy service (Preview) for Office 365 ProPlus](overview-office-client-policy-service.md)

### Office for Mac available in the Mac App Store
Office apps, such as Word and Outlook, are now available from the Mac App Store. Most require an Office 365 subscription to activate. You can use a supported enterprise mobility management (EMM) tool to deploy these apps to your users. For more information, see [Deploy Office for Mac from the Mac App Store](mac/deploy-mac-app-store.md).


## October 2018

The [Office Customization Tool](https://config.office.com/) is now generally available. The OCT makes it easy to customize your deployment of Office 365 ProPlus and other Click-to-Run Office products. Instead of building the configuration files in a text editor, you can now use this simple web-based interface. Go directly to the [tool](https://config.office.com/) or read more about it [here](overview-of-the-office-customization-tool-for-click-to-run.md).

When installing language packs, you can save network bandwidth by installing only proofing tools. For more details, see [Install proofing tools](overview-of-deploying-languages-in-office-365-proplus.md#install-proofing-tools) and [Languages, culture codes, and companion proofing languages](overview-of-deploying-languages-in-office-365-proplus.md#languages-culture-codes-and-companion-proofing-languages).

## September 2018

Office 2019 is the latest version of Microsoft's productivity software that's available as a one-time purchase from a retail store or through a volume licensing agreement. Note that Office 2019 is separate from Office that's available through Office 365 plans. For example, if you've deployed Office 365 ProPlus to the users in your organization, you don't need Office 2019. You already have all the features, and many more, that are included in Office 2019. For more details, see [Overview of Office 2019](office2019/overview.md) and [Deploy Office 2019](office2019/deploy.md).
 
## August 2018

Version 1.2 of the Readiness Toolkit was released, with new functionlity to conceal folder and file name info collected in the scan and the ability to capture add-in usage info. For more details, see [Use the Readiness Toolkit to assess application compatibility for Office 365 ProPlus](use-the-readiness-toolkit-to-assess-application-compatibility-for-office-365-pro.md).

## July 2018

You can now  use the Office Deployment Tool to apply application preferences to Office 365 ProPlus as part of an initial deployment or as an update to existing installations of Office. For more details, see [Apply application settings to Office 365 ProPlus](overview-of-the-office-2016-deployment-tool.md#apply-application-settings-to-office-365-proplus).

## June 2018

To help you uninstall versions of Office that use Windows Installer (MSI) as the installation technology, you can now use the Office Deployment Tool and specify the RemoveMSI element in your configuration.xml file. For more details, see [Remove existing MSI versions of Office when upgrading to Office 365 ProPlus](upgrade-from-msi-version.md).

For best practices for planning your deployment of Office 365 ProPlus, see [Assess your environment and requirements for deploying Office 365 ProPlus](assess-office-365-proplus.md) and [Plan your enterprise deployment of Office 365 ProPlus](plan-office-365-proplus.md).
