# Office Customization Tool (OCT) 2016 Help: Installation location and organization name

 **Summary**: Specifies a default installation file location and organization name for all users whose installation includes this customization file for Setup.
  
In the **Default installation path** box, type the path to the folder into which Setup installs Office on the user's computer. You can leave the default path, **[ProgramFilesFolder]\Microsoft Office**. 
  
This option is recognized only when Office is first installed on a user's computer; you cannot change the installation path without uninstalling and reinstalling Office.
  
Enter an **Organization name** to specify the name that displays in the **About** box, on the **Help** menu, and on the banner pages of Office applications. The name that you specify is used as the default company name for all users whose installation uses this customization file.
