# Manage add-ins by using Telemetry Dashboard in Office

 **Summary:** Describes how to improve Office performance by managing add-ins by using Telemetry Dashboard. 
  
 **Audience:** IT Professionals 
  
If you can prevent end users from running non-approved add-ins that might cause issues or slow performance, then you can reduce your support costs. If an add-in is crashing or takes a long time to load, you can disable the add-in for all Office 2016 client computers at the same time. Using Telemetry Dashboard, you can monitor add-in usage along with performance and other issues. With the collected data, you can decide which add-ins should be managed. This article points to more information about how to manage add-ins for Office by using Telemetry Dashboard.

By using the Group Policy Administrative Templates, you can also create lists of managed add-ins and optionally block any add-in that isn't on the list. Users can't override these settings unless you allow them to.
