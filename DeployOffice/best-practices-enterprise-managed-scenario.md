Enterprise Managed represents large to very large organizations, in which the work force is leveraging nearly every single technology that exists, ranging from desktops to notebooks to tablets, software distribution tools, and virtual environments like Remote Desktop Services and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure. The IT department manages the client software using software management tools such as System Center Configuration Manager, and has dedicated teams that administer the company's Active Directory components such as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), and Group Policy.
