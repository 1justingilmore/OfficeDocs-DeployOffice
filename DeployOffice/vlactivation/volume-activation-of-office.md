Microsoft policy requires the activation of all editions of Office 2016 client software, including volume license editions. For Office 2016, volume activation occurs through Office Activation Technologies, which are based on the Software Protection Platform (SPP) that is used in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2. Office Activation Technologies provides three activation methods for Office 2016: 
  
- Key Management Service (KMS) activation
    
- Multiple Activation Key (MAK) activation
    
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)-based activation
    
The model that you choose depends on the size, network infrastructure, connectivity, and security requirements in your environment. If you need more information or advice on choosing a method, start with [Plan volume activation of Office 2016](plan-volume-activation-of-office.md). If you already know the differences between the activation methods and have decided which activation method best suits your environment, you can skip directly to the article for your activation method.
