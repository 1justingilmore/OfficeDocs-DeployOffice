Cloud Managed represents generally small businesses who are generally located out of a small centralized office in a single country; however, they might have smaller remote offices throughout the country. The work force leverages the newest productivity devices and software on the market, because having a smaller organization allows for more rapid adoption of new technology. They have a small IT team that manages the entire organizational IT environment technologies such as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Azure Active Directory Password Sync, GPO, etc. The IT team does not use software distribution tools to manage client software, and no Distributed File System (DFS) exists. Network shares are leveraged for installing software, and users have administrative privileges on their client devices. The IT team provides batch files or scripts for end users to automate deployments.
