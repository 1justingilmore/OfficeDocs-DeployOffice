# Best practices: Office 2016 Mac client install for cloud managed

 *The Best Practices Guide includes deployment recommendations and real-world examples from the Office 365 Product Group and delivery experts from Microsoft Services. For a list of all the articles, see  [Best practices guide for deploying Office 365 ProPlus in the enterprise](best-practices-guide-for-deploying-office-365-proplus-in-the-enterprise.md).* 
  
    
    

This article describes how  *Cloud Managed*  should design and deploy Office 2016 for Mac. Because they have a very limited Mac population, users should self-manage and self-service from the Office 365 portal.
## Office 365 portal deployment

In a deployment situation where the user is downloading Office 2016 for Mac from the Office 365 software Portal, the following guidance is recommended:  [Download and install or reinstall Office 365 or Office 2016 on your PC or Mac](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-or-reinstall-Office-365-or-Office-2016-on-your-PC-or-Mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US). If Office installation fails, see  [What to try if you can't install Office 2016 for Mac](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-to-try-if-you-can-t-install-Office-2016-for-Mac-5efba2b4-b1e6-4e5f-bf3c-6ab945d03dea?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US).
  
    
    
For a user to install Office 2016 for Mac from the Office 365 portal, the user must have administrative privileges on their client device.
