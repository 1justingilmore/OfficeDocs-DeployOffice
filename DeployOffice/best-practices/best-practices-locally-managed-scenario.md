# Best practices: Locally managed scenario

 *The Best Practices Guide includes deployment recommendations and real-world examples from the Office 365 Product Group and delivery experts from Microsoft Services. For a list of all the articles, see [Best practices](best-practices.md).* 
  
Locally Managed represents medium to large organizations that may have offices in multiple countries, but are not considered to be globally distributed. Employees are generally located out of a centralized office in the country, with limited small offices. The work force is primarily leveraging newer productivity software, including some VDI, but the IT department does not have software distribution tools to manage client software. IT Administrators leverage a Distributed File System (DFS) and network shares to host installation packages that end users install, and utilize custom scripts and batch files for automated deployments for end users because the users do not have local admin rights. They do not have dedicated IT teams to specific products, and instead leverages shared teams that manage multiple technologies of the IT environment such as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), and Group Policy.
