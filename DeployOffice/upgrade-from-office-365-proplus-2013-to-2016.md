|July 3, 2016 (approximately)  <br/> |All Office 365 ProPlus installations that meet the criteria for a Microsoft-initiated upgrade should see the upgrade notification.  <br/> |[Criteria used to determine if Office can be upgraded successfully](overview-of-the-upgrade-of-office-365-proplus-to-the-office-2016-version.md#BKMK_Criteria) <br/> [Timing of the upgrade notifications](overview-of-the-upgrade-of-office-365-proplus-to-the-office-2016-version.md#BKMK_Timing) <br/> |
|June 21, 2016  <br/> |Microsoft-initiated upgrades resumed for computers that hadn't yet downloaded the Office 2016 upgrade files.  <br/> | Keep in mind that only Office 365 ProPlus installations that meet [certain criteria](overview-of-the-upgrade-of-office-365-proplus-to-the-office-2016-version.md#BKMK_Criteria) receive upgrade notifications. Also, [when an upgrade notification appears](overview-of-the-upgrade-of-office-365-proplus-to-the-office-2016-version.md#BKMK_Timing) can vary, even for computers in the same organization. <br/> <br/> If you don't want to get these upgrade notifications,[review this information](configure-updates-of-office-365-proplus-to-prepare-for-the-upgrade-to-the-office.md) on how to configure the computers in your organization to prevent them from being considered for these upgrades. <br/>  <br/>Users who aren't local administrators on their computer won't see an upgrade notification. We're currently investigating ways to enable non-admin users to perform the upgrade. In the meantime, if you want to upgrade those users, you can do the following: <br/> - Temporarily provide your users with administrator rights on their computer, so that they can perform the upgrade. <br/> - Deploy Office 2016 to those users by using enterprise software deployment tools, such as System Center Configuration Manager. <br/><br/>  A Microsoft-initiated upgrade isn't your only choice for upgrading your existing installations of Office 365 ProPlus. You can use the following upgrade methods and upgrade whenever is best for your organization: <br/>  - Deploy Office 2016 to your users by using enterprise software deployment tools, such as System Center Configuration Manager. <br/>  - Allow users to upgrade themselves from Office 365, if they're local administrators on their computer. <br/> |
|June 14, 2016  <br/> |Microsoft-initiated upgrades resumed for computers that had downloaded the Office 2016 upgrade files prior to May 9, 2016.  <br/> |Between May 4 and May 9, some computers might have downloaded the files needed to upgrade to Office 2016, but the user hadn't yet seen an upgrade notification. When we paused Microsoft-initiated upgrades on May 9, upgrade notifications were also paused.  <br/> <br/>We have resumed Microsoft-initiated upgrades for those computers that already have the upgrade files downloaded. This means that users, who are local administrators on those computers, will begin to see upgrade notifications.  <br/> |
|June 14, 2016  <br/> |Deferred Channel provides feature updates.  <br/><br/> First Release for Deferred Channel available to begin enterprise validation.  <br/> |If you're using Deferred Channel and Office is configured to receive updates automatically from the Office Content Delivery Network (CDN), then you get these feature updates from Deferred Channel automatically. These feature updates are in Version 1602 (Build 6741.2048). <br/> <br/> If you have a specific business need to delay receiving these feature updates from Deferred Channel, you need to manually configure Office to continue receiving the most current security updates for Version 1509 of Deferred Channel. As of June 14th, the most current release of Version 1509 is Build 6001.1082.

|May 9, 2016  <br/> |Microsoft-initiated upgrades paused.  <br/> | We identified a previously unknown caching issue with some Microsoft-initiated upgrades. This caching issue caused some Office 2013 licensing and program installation information to be deleted. Because of this issue, we've paused further Microsoft-initiated upgrades while we work on a resolution to the issue. At this time, users won't see any upgrade notifications. <br/><br/>  We have developed a fix for this issue, which we'll release prior to resuming Microsoft-initiated upgrades. Those upgrades are currently scheduled to resume on or about June 21, 2016. <br/><br/>  If you don't want to get these upgrade notifications, [review this information](configure-updates-of-office-365-proplus-to-prepare-for-the-upgrade-to-the-office.md) on how to configure the computers in your organization to prevent them from being considered for these upgrades. <br/><br/>  If you're using other upgrade methods, such as the following, you can upgrade whenever is best for your organization: <br/>  - Deploying the upgrade to your users. For example, by using enterprise software deployment tools, such as System Center Configuration Manager. <br/> - Allowing users to upgrade themselves from Office 365, if they're local administrators on their computer. <br/> |
|May 4, 2016  <br/> |Microsoft-initiated upgrades resumed.  <br/> |Microsoft-initiated upgrades are only for Office 365 ProPlus installations that are configured to receive updates automatically from the Office Content Delivery Network (CDN) and meet certain criteria.

|April 22, 2016  <br/> |Microsoft-initiated upgrades paused.  <br/> |Microsoft-initiated upgrades were paused due to an issue with the April 5, 2016 update for Outlook 2013 (KB3114941). This update can cause intermittent crashes of Lync 2013 (Skype for Business) or Outlook 2013. For more information about this issue, see Microsoft Support Knowledge Base (KB) article [3158521](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3158521).  <br/><br/> Microsoft-initiated upgrades won't resume until a fix for this issue is released. We don't want to begin an upgrade if we know there's a significant issue with Office 2013.  <br/> <br/>Some users still might see upgrade notifications, primarily users who have slow or unreliable Internet connections. That's because the files needed to upgrade to Office 2016 began downloading in the background, but didn't complete, before the Microsoft-initiated upgrades were paused. Once the download completes, users see the upgrade notification the next time they open an Office app.  <br/> |
|April 20, 2016  <br/> |Microsoft-initiated upgrades resumed to a small percentage of Office 365 ProPlus installations.  <br/> |Microsoft-initiated upgrades are only for Office 365 ProPlus installations that are configured to receive updates automatically from the Office Content Delivery Network (CDN) and meet certain criteria.
